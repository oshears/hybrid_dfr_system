# IOSTANDARD Constraints
#
# Note that these IOSTANDARD constraints are applied to all IOs currently
# assigned within an I/O bank.  If these IOSTANDARD constraints are 
# evaluated prior to other PACKAGE_PIN constraints being applied, then 
# the IOSTANDARD specified will likely not be applied properly to those 
# pins.  Therefore, bank wide IOSTANDARD constraints should be placed 
# within the XDC file in a location that is evaluated AFTER all 
# PACKAGE_PIN constraints within the target bank have been evaluated.
#
# Un-comment one or more of the following IOSTANDARD constraints according to
# the bank pin assignments that are required within a design.
