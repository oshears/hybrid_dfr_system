// This analog stimulus file is used to inject analog signals (e.g., volts, temperature) for a simulation.
// Units are as follows:
//          Time:                           nanoseconds [ns]
//          Voltage (All rails):     volts [V]
//          Temperature:             degrees C [C]. Please note that the temperature transfer function is in terms of Kelvin
